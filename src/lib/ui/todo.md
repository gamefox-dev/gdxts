- ~~most style props from [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/layout-props)~~
- (?) background and maybe border
- ~~[aspect-ratio](https://yogalayout.com/docs/aspect-ratio/)~~
- ~~all props will be optional, specified by an interface namely ActorStyle~~
- ~~default to {}, will be applied by another style object by `setStyle`~~
- ~~`setStyle` trigger recalculation of `YogaNode`~~
- ~~`YogaNode` will be private, can only be access from inside Actor~~
- react host configuration should be very easy with this kind of `style` implementation
- generic prop passing for actors from react
- (?) margin/padding horizontal/vertical/start/end
- actors?
